# Client-Server Front Side:
A form for entering numbers from 0 to 100, entering a number outside the range will result in an error.
If the entered number is correct, after pressing the Start button, a message will be displayed that everything has been sent correctly.
Also, the entire sequence of indices up to the entered number will come in response to our request.
If the delay between responses is less than 50 milliseconds, an error will also appear, but in the console.

Enjoy the results
